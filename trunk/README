This code generates the "derivative superstructures" of a parent
lattice. It works for general lattices (including "multilattices" like
HCP) and can enumerate in a restricted concentration range.

A discussion of the algorithm and its applications can be found in the
following publications:

derivative structures," Phys. Rev. B 77 224115 (26 June 2008)

structures from multilattices: Application to hcp alloys,"

derivative structures at a fixed concentration," (submitted to PRB,

If you use this code in a publication, we would appreciate it if you
would cite these papers. Thank you.


To compile the code, first unpack the tar file:
tar -xvf enum.tar.gz

Next, compile the symmetry library. Go to the celib/trunk directory:
cd celib/trunk

Set an environment variable to identify your fortran compiler:
[in the bash shell, gfortran compiler]
export F90=gfortran
[the make file also recognizes ifort]

Then compile using the Makefile:
make

Next, make the enumeration library
cd ../../enumlib/trunk
make

To make a stand-alone executable for enumeration:
make multienum.x

Example input files are in the "input" directory. 

There are also helper programs for making VASP POSCARs, pictures of
2-D enumerations, etc.

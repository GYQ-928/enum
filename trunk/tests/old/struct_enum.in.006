.5 .5 0    # First lattice vector (only columns 2 and 3 in rows 2 and 3 are used
.5 0 .6    # Second lattice vector
0 .5 .6    # Third lattice vector

1 10       # Enumerate all cells up to 10-atom cells 
.0001      # Finite precision parameter
part       # Label exchanges are equal (AACB==BBAC) and don't include binary labelings too

Simple cubic
bulk       # Bulk case (i.e., 3D not 2D)
1 0 0      # First lattice vector (only columns 2 and 3 in rows 2 and 3 are used
0 1 0      # Second lattice vector
0 0 1      # Third lattice vector
1          # One lattice point/unit cell
 0 0 0     # That lattice point is at the origin
2          # binary case
2 8        # Enumerate 8-atom cells only
.0001      # Finite precision parameter
part       # Only generate a partial listing (e.g. consider AAAB==BBBA)
